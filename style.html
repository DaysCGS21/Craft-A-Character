            <p>Fashion and looks may not be of interest to many people, but they are vital traits when designing a character. Whether it’s their hairstyle, color features, outfit, or other, it tells about the character, their preferences, their setting, and their experience. It also allows them to stand out from other characters.</p>

        <div class="droptxt">
            <p class="darktxt">Hair length can tell a lot about a character. Long hair can imply elegance, experience, virtue, and at worst, isolation. Meanwhile, short hair can imply that the character is fresh, active, rebellious, or signify a change.
            Hairdos can indicate the personality or life of a character. Spiky hair can show the character as active and energetic, though it can also imply that they are rebellious. Hair that is picked up, like a ponytail or so, makes the character look organized, while hair that is too loose tells that the individual is lacking in self care. If the hair is held at the top side of the head, the character is most likely energetic, fun, and active, while hair held on the lower side can make the character look calm and collective, seeking for simplified ways. Of course, this is not always the case, as some hairstyles and hairdos are based on tradition and culture.</p>

            <h3 class="stylehead">Coloring</h3>
            <div class="droptxt">
            <p class="darktxt">The natural colors that characters have on their body tells a lot about who and what they are. The hair, skin, and eye colors help the audience identify their ethnicity, race, and at times, age. It can also indicate the difference from others, such as a girl with blue eyes in a town full of people with red eyes. It may also signify the character as important. Maybe the boy with green hair is meant to be the sage of nature, as an example. That being said, some characters don’t keep their natural colors, having the option to change them to fit their mindset and views.

            <h3 class="stylehead">Fashion</h3>
            <div class="droptxt">
            <p class="darktxt">The fashion and outfits of a character not only tells us about the character, but aspects of the story as well. Looking at the character’s attire, we are able to identify the setting, time era, and culture that the character comes from. For example, when looking at Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean, we can tell that he is a pirate from an era where ships were the main method of travel and trade, as his lack of cleanliness indicates that his lifestyle is not a noble one. Characters do have choice in their outfits and will unconsciously wear clothes that fit their ideals and personality. A student character may use a uniform, but wear them differently than the other students do, signifying that they aim to be different.</p>

            <h3 class="stylehead">Features</h3>
            <div class="droptxt">
            <p class="darktxt">Character features can add variety to them. They can have differences in size, shapes of certain limbs, amount of limbs, physique, as well as added features like scars. Aspects such as scars and missing limbs can hint to certain experiences. Maybe something happened to them and they have to live with that reminder, or in the case of missing a limb, they might have been born with it. Certain features can also tell the audience what species they are. Perhaps they are a fantasy race, like elves, dwarfs, or giants.</p>
