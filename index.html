            <p>What is the most important element in a story? Characters. They are what move the plot and portray the themes. A character is also what the reader or viewer follow to get to know this unknown world they are going into. From books and plays to movies and games, characters have become a popular topic in social media and even inspirations. Everyone has a favorite character due to their aspects or because they relate to them. With that said, who is your favorite character? What do you like about them? What is their role in a story? What do they look like if they have been visualized? These are some of the questions that a writer or creator can use to create their own character.</p>
            <p>Whether you're writing a book, making a cartoon, or just developing a character in Dungeons and Dragons, there are certain aspects you have to think about when creating a character. Who are they? What do they look like? What are their personalities and themes? How are they treated in the story? What is their role? These will help the audience identify them and may even want to know more about them.</p>
