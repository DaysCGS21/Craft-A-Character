            <p class="darktxt">For media that includes color, Color is a major tool for design. It conveys the message or theme the creator is trying to portray. Such example is when green is used to represent flora and nature, while blue and pink colors are used or gender reveals in baby showers. For characters, it lets us know about them, their personality, lifestyle, and even standards. It isn’t always the case, but it is a common design tactic. Like many Pokemon, Pikachu’s color represents its type, yellow for electricity, while Mario’s colors represent his courage and energy. Of course, colors can also be used as a subversion of the trope, allowing the creator to provide a message. Luke Skywalker starts out with pale colors as he starts on the light side of the force. Through the movies, his colors start to darken as his connection to Darth Vader becomes deeper. In Return of Jedi, he wears black attire as he is close to falling to the dark side. However, he chooses not to, becoming a true jedi. As this example shows, colors can also be used to tell a story within the character.</p>
