            <p class="darktxt">Looks and Personality are important to designing a character, but what about their place in the story? How do you treat this character? How does the audience view them? Is it what you intended? One should be careful on how they treat their characters in the story, making sure they are portrayed well and as intended. It is easy to ruin a character.</p>

                <h3 class="darkhead">Character Development</h3>
                <p class="darktxt">What’s their depth, personality, and motivations at the beginning? Characters start out with a personality. Maybe they are a naive teen who dreams of exploring the place they are told not to go to. Or maybe they are a spoiled, rich person who doesn’t care much about the world. While morally good characters are common for protagonists, don’t be afraid of making a character who begins with negative morals. It makes bigger room for the character to grow. Of course, morally good characters still have the potential to grow.How do they change throughout the story? Depending on how the character starts, the change they get through the story varies. The good character may start a simple life, but learns that the life out there is rough and damaging. Luke Skywalker started out with a simple life, dreaming of going out to space and even wants to become a jedi. Throughout the course of the story, however, his life becomes more complicated, losing his guardians and mentor, his friends getting in danger, and losing his hand after confronting Darth Vader. These experiences taught him to be mindful and not immediately jump into action.</p>

                <h3 class="darkhead">Character Arc</h3>
                <p class="darktxt">Why does the character develop throughout the story? Some events cause the character to change their views, methods, and morals. Depending on the character, they can have a positive, negative, transformative, and a flat arc.</p>
                <div class="carc">
                    <h4 class="darkhead">Positive Arc</h4>
                    <img src="imagePlaceholder.png" alt="Hero" class="emblem">
                    <p class="darktxt">The positive arc is for the characters who start off in a negative light, but then change for the betterment, making them redeemable. One example is Kuzco from The Emperor’s New Groove, who starts off as a selfish ruler. After a course of events of becoming a llama and getting helped by Pacha, he becomes sympathetic and grows mindful of his people.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="carc">
                    <h4 class="darkhead">Negative Arc</h4>
                    <img src="imagePlaceholder.png" alt="Hero" class="emblem">
                    <p class="darktxt">The negative arc occurs when the character starts off on the good side, but eventually goes on the deep end. Anakin Skywalker was a formidable jedi who fought to maintain peace in the galaxy. However, a turn of events caused him to betray the Jedi and help give rise to the Empire, becoming Darth Vader.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="carc">
                    <h4 class="darkhead">Transformative Arc</h4>
                    <img src="imagePlaceholder.png" alt="Hero" class="emblem">
                    <p class="darktxt">The transformative arc is more so for the characters that start off a simple or miniscule life, but then grow into a stronger or better person. In The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, Link starts out as a knight in training with the tendency of being lazy. After his friend is in peril, though, he sets out on a journey to save her; and by the end of the journey, he becomes the hero that defeats the demon king.</p>

                <div class="carc">
                    <h4 class="darkhead">Flat Arc</h4>
                    <img src="imagePlaceholder.png" alt="Hero" class="emblem">
                    <p class="darktxt">The flat arc is about the characters that go through the story without changing. While some may deem these boring, they can cause a lot of impact on the story. Goku from the Dragon Ball series starts off as optimistic and competitive. No matter how many enemies he faces, he doesn’t change his traits, remaining a positive individual. As a result some of his enemies have become allies, as well as gaining more friends. His capabilities also change characters to become better, worse, or stronger.</p>

                <h3 class="darkhead">Quirks and Flaws</h3>
                <p class="darktxt">There is no such thing as a perfect person. Just like people in real life, characters have their positives and negatives. Hercules/Heracles may be known to be a hero with incredible strength and courage, but his wrath gave him a lot of consequences, including the murder of his family. Make sure your character has both qualities and flaws. The good qualities help attract both other characters and the audience. Any good trait should be enough to have the audience cheer for them as they go through the story. Flaws give characters the opportunity to develop and better themselves, along as driving the plot and bringing obstacles for them to face.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                        <img src="Images/.png" alt="Katara" class="sourceimg">
                <h3 class="darkhead">Consistency</h3>
                <p class="darktxt">Every character has a core personality. Certain events make them act in a certain way, and can keep occurring. Of course, there may be times where the character will act differently, which brings interest from both the audience and the other characters. However, this has to appear naturally. Perhaps an event makes the character re-evaluate things and try something new. It should not be immediate. Katara from Avatar: The Last AirBender is the caregiver of the group, always watching over the others. Like many, she doesn’t see anyone in the fire nation in good light, because of them causing the death of her mother. When she meets Jet and sees his extremism, she sees that not all sides are black and white. After some time, she ends up stuck with Zuko, the Fire Nation’s Prince and is spiteful at first, but then opens up after realizing they had a similar experience. Unfortunately, this doesn’t last long as he betrays her. During her time in the Fire nation, she starts to see how a lot of the people are innocent, even driving her to help a dying town. By the time Zuko betrays the Fire Lord and joins the team, she is the last one who doesn’t accept him, as she already experienced his betrayal. After some time helping the others, Zuko offers to help her find her mother’s killer, giving them more time to talk and letting her express the trauma she faced. As a result, she ends up forgiving Zuko. If your character is going to do something unusual to them, have it make sense that they are doing so. If there is a change, give them time to process and embrace it.</p>

                <h3 class="darkhead">Relatability</h3>
                <p class="darktxt">The important way to connect the audience to the characters is relatability. Of course, characters don’t have our life and don’t experience what we do, especially with fantasy. However, that doesn’t mean there isn’t something we can’t find in common. Frodo from The Lord of the Rings is a hobbit from The Shire, having to fight orcs and shadow beings, something that we won’t experience in our lives. What we might find in common with Frodo, though, is the feeling of responsibility and the dependance from others. As well as the comfort we share with our friends who have our backs. Characters can also have similar flaws to ours; fear of the unknown, self doubt, and even incompetence. This relatability can help the audience grow along with the character and learn valuable lessons.</p>

                <h3 class="darkhead">Sterotypes and Cliches</h3>
                <p class="darktxt">Some characters fall into stereotypes and cliches. The main character will always end up with the love interest, or they end up getting amnesia. To be fair, stereotypes and cliches aren’t exactly a bad thing, but it may end up with the character being too predictable and similar to other characters. If you use a common trope for a character, make sure it is meaningful and beneficial for the character.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                        <img src="imagePlaceholder.png" alt="Hero" class="emblem">
                <h3 class="darkhead">Inconsistency</h3>
                <p class="darktxt">You may want to have a plot point happen in the story and it requires the character to act. However, the character may not normally do the certain action and go out of character. As a result, the audience ends up confused and sometimes disappointed in the character’s sudden change. They can potentially lose interest in the character and the story. In the web series RWBY, there is a character known as General Ironwood. He was the general of a huge army and one of the people in charge of a city. Though he was strict on some occasions, he had a good heart, encouraging the youth to fight if they wanted to or flee if they didn’t want to. “No one will shame you if you do”. He would even help those who were severely injured and do his best to provide safety to the people. Unfortunately, circumstances drove him to put the city on lock down, making the protagonists question him. Regardless, he trusted them and even shared his secrets. The protagonists, however, kept vital secrets from him and often criticized his decisions. He would take and consider the critiques, even risking his arm to stop the villain. However, he found out about what the protagonists kept from him and eventually ordered his army to arrest them as he would attempt a desperate measure. In the season after this event, he suddenly changes into insanity, killing an armless man and becoming more strict. Eventually he blackmails the protagonists by threatening to bomb the city he was protecting. He ends up defeated by his subordinates and killed by the villains. Some plot points seem like a good idea, but be sure to keep the characters in mind. They are not just a chess piece.</p>

                <h3 class="darkhead">Lack of Flaws</h3>
                <p class="darktxt">Despite there being no such thing as a perfect character, a character can end up flawless. Without flaws, there is no room for the characters to grow. This also brings a lack of relatability with the audience, giving them less of a reason to follow the character. One example is Rey from the Disney Star Wars sequels. From the first movie, she was already skilled as a pilot despite never having practiced. At the first attempt, she manages to use the force and mind trick a soldier, eventually leading her to defeat the trained and skilled Kylo Ren in a lightsaber battle. There is not a lightsaber battle she loses, even defeating Luke Skywalker and Emperor Palpatine. Out of context, this seems unrealistic, even in a sci-fi series. As a result, many of the audience began hating the character and even forgetting that they existed. Do not forget to give flaws to your characters.</p>

                <h3 class="darkhead">Boring and Pointless</h3>
                <p class="darktxt">When focusing on the story, a character can end up being boring. Either they don’t have any likable traits or they provide nothing to the story. In this situation, the audience could end up abandoning the story to seek better entertainment. They can also end up being pointless. In Season 4 of Miraculous Ladybug, the character Zoe was introduced as a new hero. While she is a kind hearted character, she bends in with the rest of the group and doesn’t provide anything new. In fact, she doesn’t say or act in any way the other characters haven’t, making the fans question her stay in the series. Remember to give your characters a purpose in the story, as well as a trait to attract the audience to follow them. Perhaps give them a fun attitude or an intriguing backstory that makes people want to learn more about them.</p>
